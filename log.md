# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2
**Saturday, October 19, 2019**

Completed the rest of Section 17  of the Complete React Developer Course! Got some good practice working with media queries/breakpoints, creating & importing partial files/using selectors to target specific elements or decendants of specific elements, and setting up variables for reusing colors, font sizes/styles, and margin/padding amounts.

Also had a good refresher on the difference between inline and inline-block..

**display: inline**
- **cannot** set width and height of an element
- top & bottom margins are **not** respected

**display: inline-block**
- can set width and height of an element
- top & bottom margins are respected

Deployed version of the Expensify app with added styles is up at https://e-x-pensify.herokuapp.com/

### Day 1
**Friday, October 18, 2019**

Picked back up with Section 17 of Andrew Mead's Complete React Developer Course. Completed the first two videos of the section which detailed the process of refactoring and adding styles to LoginPage and Header. It was fun seeing Sass again (maybe it's been close to a year?) and trying to remember some of the concepts (partials, nested selectors, variables, BEM).

Also had to solve an error being thrown by Firebase due to missing .env files (sadly lost in the Great Hard Drive Crash of September 2019 ðŸ˜ª). Had everything back up and running in just a handful of minutes, which I was really proud of.
