# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1
**Friday, October 18, 2019**

Picked back up with Section 17 of Andrew Mead's Complete React Developer Course. Completed the first two videos of the section which detailed the process of refactoring and adding styles to LoginPage and Header. It was fun seeing Sass again (maybe it's been close to a year?) and trying to remember some of the concepts (partials, nested selectors, variables, BEM).

Also had to solve an error being thrown by Firebase due to missing .env files (sadly lost in the Great Hard Drive Crash of September 2019 ðŸ˜ª). Had everything back up and running in just a handful of minutes, which I was really proud of.
