# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 39

Super tired rn, but gonna make a quick log.

Worked on the journal / got a few more components started (Slider, Toggle) and Rating seems pretty much done. Grappling with the spacing quite a bit, feel like I should maybe dig into the docs on theme.spacing() tomorrow.. figure out how to do all that.

Also read the *Clean Code* chapter on classes and did some extra reading on private vs. public variables, static vs. non-static variables, coupling, and cohesion.

Ok goodnight


### Day 38

Only had a little time to work on stuff today, but got a decent start on creating a Rating compoment for the journal, and learned that passing `multiline={true}` to the MUI TextField compoment will convert it from a standard input to a textarea. Pretty cool!

Also started reading Chapter 10 of *Clean Code* and have a growing list of OOP concepts to look up/understand better. So far it's just:
- what are private and public variables?
- what are static variables?

Was hoping to have more time to read up on everything tonight but I think it'll have to wait til tomorrow..

Til then!


### Day 37

Spent pretty much the entire day reading docs and playing around with Material-UI and Formik. Starting to get a better system going for Journal. Definitely gonna be a bit of work these next few days as I figure out how to re-implement what I had going on with some of the Ant Design components, but shouldn't be too crazy.

TIL about:
- **jsconfig.json files** https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig
	- *started quickly looking at ways to set up absolute paths in a create react app and I guess doing it via a jsconfig.json file is the recommended way in the CRA docs* https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component/#absolute-imports
- **index.lock files in git**
	- *experienced a weird new error i've never seen before. was happening every time i was trying to stage changes in SourceTree. seems maybe kind of common? read a few things briefly, but seems like the way to solve it is by running* `rm -f .git/index.lock`

Okay I'm fried. See ya tomorrow.


### Day 36

Had a really fun day today with coding! Spent the evening doing some research / getting inspiration for my personal website. Looked at a bunch of other front end dev's portfolios and took down a bunch of notes.

During the couple hours of research, I started scratching the surface of a cool new programmer/art/intellectual world that I want to get more involved with. Here are a bunch of links related to that scratching..

After all of that fun digging, I was feeling super motivated and excited to start rethinking a few parts of the Journal project. Been heavily considering ditching the Ant Design stuff and trying out a different UI library. Was looking at Material Design for a while tonight but after scratching my head just trying to get it imported, I realized that it's massively complicated and that Material-UI is actually the way to go. Spent some time getting that set up and then playing around with colors and the ThemeProvider. Feel really excited to keep digging on all of that tomorrow.

Ciao!


### Day 35
**Thursday, November 21, 2019**

Man this thing is a crazy ride. Learning every day..

Went to bed early last night and woke up today feeling a little lighter. Tried not to set too many expectations or programming goals for the day, and just started out by reading some of *Clean Code* and a couple articles.. *(links below)*

After that I tried taking another crack at the refactor stuff for Restock that I've been struggling with. Wound up getting tangled in it again and decided I'm gonna have to leave that one for later and move on. Feels really discouraging to have been working at it now for a couple days and to not be seeing any results.

After forfeiting on the Restock stuff, I started digging into the freeCodeCamp section on Object Oriented Programming. Feels fun so far. Made it through 11 out of the 26 challenges for the section.

### Day 34
**Wednesday, November 20, 2019**

Had a mostly pretty frustrating day today. I think I'm burning out a bit.

Spent pretty much the whole day coding again, but tried to step away and take a few breaks.

Was able to finish the Basic Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodecamp. The last challenge really threw me for a loop.. feel like I spent way too long on that one, and in the end had to look up hints for how to solve it. Either way, solutions for the last 3 challenges are below.

Also read a copule chapters in *Clean Code* and spent some time trying to refactor things in Restock. Still trying to figure out the split reducer stuff, and if I can move the handleUpdateOrder logic out of App.js and into the components that call the ADD/UPDATE/REMOVE actions. As I work on it more I'm struggling to see if it's even possible to separate some of the layers given the way it's built. Might spend a little time on it tomorrow, but kind of feeling like I should maybe ditch the refactor stuff and move on. Find out tomorrow..

Here're today's solutions from Basic Algorithm Scripting..

**Where do I Belong**

```
function getIndexToIns(arr, num) {
  let indexToIns = 0;
  const sorted = arr.sort();

  for (let i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {
    if (num > sorted[i]) {
      indexToIns++;
    }
  }
  return indexToIns;
}

getIndexToIns([40, 60], 50);
```

**Mutations**

```
function mutation(arr) {
  const string = arr[0].toLowerCase();
  const characters = arr[1].toLowerCase().split('');
  return characters.every(character => string.includes(character));
}

mutation(["hello", "hey"]);
```

**Chunky Monkey**

```
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  const chunks = [];
  while (arr.length > 0)
    chunks.push(arr.splice(0, size));
  return chunks;
  // const chunks = [];
  // const numOfChunks = Math.ceil(arr.length / size);
  // for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {
  //   const remainingItems = arr.length - i;
  //   if (remainingItems <= size) {
  //     const chunk = arr.slice(i);
  //     chunks.push(chunk);
  //   }
  //   const chunk = arr.slice(i, size);
  //   chunks.push(chunk);
  // }
  // console.log(chunks);
  // return chunks;
}

chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2);
```

### Day 33
**Tuesday, November 19, 2019**

Got to spend pretty much the entire day working on coding today. Not sure if you'd be able to tell that or not from what I accomplished but it was nice to have the entire day to dig into a handful of different things.

Spent the morning kind of assessing my goals for the week and took another stab at setting up some tests for Restock. With a little help from my buddy Dylan I realized I don't actually need a testing library for what I'm doing right now and was able to get some basic Jest tests going for my reducer file.

After that I spent a couple hours working on splitting up the Restock reducer logic into section and item reducers, and tried to break up the handleUpdateOrder function into some smaller and more specific functions. Got kinda lost in it all and started feeling frustrated so decided to step away for the day and try something else.

The last little bit of the day I spent working through more challenges on freeCodeCamp. Made it through 13 of the 16 challenges in the Basic Algorithm Scripting section, and saved all of my solutions as I went through to be able to look back at. Think I'll post them here for safe keeping..

**Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit**

```
function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32;
  return fahrenheit;
}

convertToF(30);
```

**Reverse a String**

```
function reverseString(str) {
  const arr = str.split('');
  const reversedStr = arr.reduceRight((acc, char) => {
    return acc + char;
  })
  return reversedStr;
}

reverseString("hello");
```

- **note:** could use .join(‚Äò‚Äô) instead of .reduceRight(...)

**Factorialize a Number**

```
function factorialize(num) {
  if (num <= 1) return 1;
  return num * factorialize(num - 1);
}
console.log(factorialize(5));
factorialize(5);
```

**Find the Longest Word in a String**

```
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  const arr = str.split(" ");
  let longestLength = 0;
  arr.map(word => {
    if (word.length > longestLength) {
      return longestLength = word.length;
    }
  });
  return longestLength;
}

findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog");
```

**Return Largest Numbers in Arrays**

```
function largestOfFour(arr) {
  let largestNumbers = [];
  arr.map(subArray => {
    let largestNumber = subArray[0];
    subArray.map(number => {
      if (number > largestNumber) {
        largestNumber = number;
      }
    })
    largestNumbers.push(largestNumber);
  });
  return largestNumbers;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
```

**Confirm the Ending**

```
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  const charsFromEnd = str.length - target.length;
  const ending = str.substring(charsFromEnd);
  return ending === target;
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n");
```

**Repeat a String Repeat a String**

```
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  if (num < 1) return "";
  return str + repeatStringNumTimes(str, num - 1);
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3);
```

**Truncate a String**

```
function truncateString(str, num) {
  if (str.length > num) {
    return str.substring(0, num) + "..."
  }
  return str;
}

truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", 8);
```

- **note:** could also use a ternary, might look nicer

**Finders Keepers**

```
function findElement(arr, func) {
  return arr.find(element => func(element))
}

findElement([1, 2, 3, 4], num => num % 2 === 0);
```
**Boo who**

```
function booWho(bool) {
  // What is the new fad diet for ghost developers? The Boolean.
  return typeof bool === "boolean";
}

booWho(null);
```

**Title Case a Sentence**

```
function titleCase(str) {
  const words = str.split(" ");
  const capitalized = words.map(word => {
    const firstLetter = word.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase();
    const remainingLetters = word.slice(1).toLowerCase();
    return firstLetter + remainingLetters;
  })
  return capitalized.join(" ");
}

titleCase("I'm a little tea pot");
```

**Slice and Splice**

```
function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  const beginning = arr2.slice(0, n);
  const end = arr2.slice(n);
  const combined = [...beginning, ...arr1, ...end];
  return combined;
}

frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);
```

**Falsy Bouncer**

```
function bouncer(arr) {
  return arr.filter(item => !!item !== false);
}

bouncer([7, "ate", "", false, 9]);
```


### Day 32
**Monday, November 18, 2019**

Got to work on things for an hour or so before work this morning and an hour or so after dinner. Was able to complete the remaining lessons in the Basic Data Structures section, but not without a bit of trouble üòÖ

Had a really tough time for some reason with the *Check if an Object has a Property* and *Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement* challenges. The first one I think I was making overly complicated by trying to use the wrong array method for the job (.map instead of .every) and not thinking about where I was placing my return values. For the for...in one, I was just being dumb and not realizng that user is a variable (see below) and therefore I should be using bracket notation. Here was my answer for the second challenge..

```
function countOnline(usersObj) {
  // change code below this line
  let onlineUsers = 0;
  for (let user in usersObj) {
    usersObj[user].online && onlineUsers++;
  }
  return onlineUsers;
  // change code above this line
}

```

I also think there were a few times I had issues just because I was forgetting the variable declaration keyword.. so um, just a reminder that you got use let or const üôÉ


### Day 31
**Sunday, November 17, 2019**

Completed the freeCodeCamp section on Debugging and made it halfway through the following section on Basic Data Structures. Feels like review, but honestly never hurts to do a refresher on the array methods..

- `.push()`
	- takes one or more elements as parameters and adds those elements to the end of an array
	- returns the new length of the array
- `.unshift()`
	- takes one or more elements as parameters and adds those elements to the beginning of an array
	- returns the new length of the array
- `.pop()`
	- takes no parameters
	- removes a single element from the end of an array
	- returns the removed item 
- `.shift()`
	- takes no parameters
	- removes a single element from the beginning of an array
	- returns the removed item
- `.splice()`
	- removes any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array
	- takes up to 3 parameters
       	1. index at which to begin removing elements
        2. number of elements to remove
        3. element, or elements separated by commas, to add to the array in place of the removed elements
	- modifies the array it‚Äôs called on and also returns a new array containing the values of the removed elements
- `.slice()`
	- copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it was called upon untouched
	- takes 2 parameters
        1. index at which to begin extraction
        2. index at which to stop extraction *(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index)*
- `.indexOf()`
	- checks for the presence of an element in an array
	- takes an element as a parameter
	- returns the position (index) of the given element, or -1 if the element does not exist in the array


### Day 30
**Saturday, November 16, 2019**

Completed the remaining 20 challenges in the Regular Expressions section üèÜ

Some takeaways..

- `^` = matches pattern at the beginning of a string
- `$` = matches pattern at the end of a string
- `\w` = [A-Za-z0-9_] (matches all letters, numbers, and underscore)
- `\W` = [^A-Za-z0-9_] (matches everything but letters, numbers, and underscore)
- `\d` = [0-9] (matches all numbers)
- `\D` = [^0-9] (matches everything but numbers)
- `\s` = [ \r\t\f\n\v] (matches all whitespace characters)
- `\S` = [^ \r\t\f\n\v] (matches everything but whitespace characters)
- `?` = checks for zero or one of the preceding element
- `?=` = positive lookahead
- `?!` = negative lookahead

Also spent a little time trying out some tests with both react-native-testing-library and native-testing-library.. still not sure what to do about all of that.

Pretty wiped out after 30 days straight, but feeling really motivated and excited to keep at it. See ya tomorrow.


### Day 29
**Friday, November 15, 2019**

Still scratching my head a bit about the React Native testing stuff. Followed the Expo docs on setting up Jest, but am still a bit confused about whether to use react-native-testing-library or native-testing-library. Did some reading and enjoyed these couple articles:

- [Why Native Testing Library Exists - Brandon Carroll - Medium](https://medium.com/@brandoncarroll/why-native-testing-library-exists-629ffb85cae2)
- [Hello, Native Testing Library üëã - Brandon Carroll - Medium](https://medium.com/@brandoncarroll/hello-native-testing-library-91ea326ea0f5)

Also worked through a handful more lessons in the freeCodeCamp Regex section. Learned about:

- `.` ‚Äî wildcard character
- `[0-9a-z]` - character class/set
- `[^0-9a-z]` ‚Äî¬†negated character class/set
- `+` ‚Äî¬†character or set occurs one or more times
- `*` ‚Äî character or set occurs zero or more times


### Day 28
**Thursday, November 14, 2019**

Completed the rest of the section on ES6 for the Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp üèÜ Started working through a few lessons in the next section on Regular Expressions.

Also spent some time looking into a few different improvements to the Restock project. Played around with adding a clear button ('x') that appears after an item is checked off on the Checklist screen. Mostly got it working but something is up with the way that the item count is rendered in the Counter componenets on the Form screen. Gotta look into that more.

Briefly took a look at Dylan's suggestion of splitting up my reducer logic into section and item reducers. Not quite sure yet how to do this with hooks as compared to combineReducers in Redux, but did find this article to maybe dig into further..

- [Build Your Own React-Redux Using useReducer and useContext Hooks](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-our-own-react-redux-using-usereducer-and-usecontext-hooks-a5574b526475)

Spent some time as well looking into setting up testing for Restock, but ran out of brain-energy after a bit. Here are the tabs I had open on getting things set up with React Native Testing Library/Jest/Expo..

- [Install ¬∑ React Native Testing Library](https://www.native-testing-library.com/docs/install)
- [react/packages/react-test-renderer at master ¬∑ facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-test-renderer)
- [Configuring Jest ¬∑ Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration)
- [Testing with Jest - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/testing-with-jest/)


### Day 27
**Wednesday, November 13, 2019**

Finished the last two challenges on recursion in the Basic JavaScript section and feel like I'm getting a better handle on writing and understanding recursive functions.

Broke down this function from the second to last challenge to help illustrate what each recursive call does..

```
function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
  if (endNum === startNum) {
    return [endNum];
  } else {
    var numbers = rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum - 1);
    numbers.push(endNum);
    return numbers;
  }
};
```

**Q:** What happens when we call `rangeOfNumbers(1, 5)`?

- rangeOfNumbers(1, 5)
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 5 -1).push(5);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 4).push(5);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2, 3, 4].push(5);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
- rangeOfNumbers(1, 4)
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 4 -1).push(4);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 3).push(4);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2, 3].push(4);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2, 3, 4];`
- rangeOfNumbers(1, 3)
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 3 -1).push(3);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 2).push(3);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2].push(3);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2, 3];`
- rangeOfNumbers(1, 2)
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 2 - 1).push(2);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `rangeOfNumbers(1, 1).push(2);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1].push(2);`
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1, 2];`
- rangeOfNumbers(1, 1)
	- OR ‚û°Ô∏è `[1];`

Also started working through the next seciton on ES6. It was kinda wild to see how many of the new features introduced in ES6 are so core to how I write JavaScript. Lessons so far have been mostly on var/let/const, arrow functions, spread, rest, and destructuring. A few quick take aways:

- When you declare a variable with `var`, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.
- When you declare a variable with `let` inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
- Any attempt at changing the object passed to Object.freeze() will be rejected without an error.
- Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name **after** a colon when assigning the value. üÜíüÜï

```
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
// userName = 'John Doe', userAge = 34
```



### Day 26
**Tuesday, November 12, 2019**

Finished reading and taking notes on the "Learn and Understand Recursion" article from yesterday. Still wrapping my head around writing recursive functions but I think the general ideas are there.

Also worked through a handful more chanllenges on freeCodeCamp.. today they were mostly focused on recursion, parseInt(), and Math.random(). Got pretty hung up on [this challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/profile-lookup) and after toiling for a long while, I ended up reading the challenge hints and realized I had everything correct except for the placement of one of the return statements. I think the way I had it initially was causing the for loop to return early, so not every item in the array was actually being looped over.

Ultimately this caused me to realize that I think I've had some misconceptions about for loops + .map().. thinking that they were the exact same thing (they're not) and that neither could return early (they can, or at least the for loop can). Either way, I think I gotta do some more solidifying/resetting my understanding of for loops!

Keepin' at it tomorrow. Will definitely be able to wrap up the Basic JavaScript section, only two challenges left! üèÜ

Ciao!


### Day 25
**Monday, November 11, 2019**

Worked through a few freeCodeCamp challenges on looping and recursion this morning before work. Also spent a little time with this article on recursion.. [Learn and Understand Recursion in JavaScript - codeburst](https://codeburst.io/learn-and-understand-recursion-in-javascript-b588218e87ea)

A few takeaways from the first half of the article:
- **recursion** ‚û°Ô∏è when a function calls itself
- **factorial** ‚û°Ô∏è the product of an integer and all the integers below it

- The three key features of recursion:
	- 1Ô∏è‚É£ A Termination Condition ‚Äî *if (something bad happened) { STOP };*
	- 2Ô∏è‚É£ A Base Case ‚Äî *if (this happens) { Yay! We're done };*
	- 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Recursion ‚Äî *our function calling itself*
	
More on all of this tomorrow... Ciao!


### Day 24
**Sunday, November 10, 2019**

Spent a couple hours working on the freeCodeCamp stuff tonight after work. Made it through 25 more challenges, so that puts us at 92/110 completed. 18 more to go in this section! üèÜ

The last challenge I worked on tonight (Record Collection) really threw me for a loop for some reason, maybe I'm just tired.. Either way, I saved my solution to be able to look back at. Took a while to get there (was trying to approach it all out of order for a while üòû) but I'm proud of myself for pushing through and happy with the intent around the function names (trying to practice what I've been reading in *Clean Code*). Still plenty of room to improve, but moving in the right direction. Here's my solution..

```
// Setup
var collection = {
  2548: {
    album: "Slippery When Wet",
    artist: "Bon Jovi",
    tracks: [
      "Let It Rock",
      "You Give Love a Bad Name"
    ]
  },
  2468: {
    album: "1999",
    artist: "Prince",
    tracks: [
      "1999",
      "Little Red Corvette"
    ]
  },
  1245: {
    artist: "Robert Palmer",
    tracks: [ ]
  },
  5439: {
    album: "ABBA Gold"
  }
};

// Only change code below this line
function propIsTracks(prop) {
  return prop === "tracks";
}

function entryHasTracksProp(id) {
  return collection[id].hasOwnProperty("tracks");
}

function valueIsEmptyString(value) {
  return value === "";
}

function updateRecords(id, prop, value) {
  if (valueIsEmptyString(value)) {
    delete collection[id][prop];
  } else {
    if (propIsTracks(prop)) {
      if (!entryHasTracksProp(id)) {
        collection[id].tracks = [];
      }
      collection[id].tracks.push(value);
    } else {
      collection[id][prop] = value;
    }
  }
  return collection;
}

// Alter values below to test your code
updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA");
```


### Day 23
**Saturday, November 9, 2019**

Starting to feel the burn of doing this every day with no breaks. Also starting to feel a craving for a little more structure/guidance. Decided to try picking back up with some lessons on freeCodeCamp in response to that craving, but rather than jump back into the HTML/CSS stuff I had started at the beginning of the year thought it might be more beneficial to start with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Blew through 67 of the 110 lessons in the Basic JavaScript section today, and took some notes while I did it to help cement some of the early concepts and to remind me of a few things I had forgotten.


### Day 22
**Friday, November 8, 2019**

Holy cow, what a day. Made a snap decision late last night to buy a domain name ( [arlenpeiffer.io](https://arlenpeiffer.io) ) and set up a portfolio site for myself.

Spent the morning today reading up on how to get everything set up for the new domain.. figured out hosting (went with Netlify) and learned about SSL certificates (stands for Secure Sockets Layer and it's what https uses to make a secure connection), DNS (Domain Name Server), CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), and nameservers (the portion of your DNS records that enable people to use your domain name rather than a complex IP address to access your site).

After I decided to go with Netlify for hosting and got all of the nameservers switched over for that, I started to read up on Gatsby (I think that's what I'd like to try using to make my portfolio). Set up a new repo and played around for a while but ended up deciding to make the little landing page for the site with CRA. Think i need a little more time to play around with and understand the Gatsby world..

Here are a few notes I took this morning about Gatsby and the Gatsby CLI:

- **install Gatsby CLI:** ``npm install -g gatsby-cli``

- **create new site:** ``gatsby new arlenpeiffer.io``

- **start dev server:** ``gatsby develop``

### Day 21
**Thursday, November 7, 2019**

Published v1 of Restock! It's up at https://expo.io/@arlenpeiffer/restock

Currently I think it's only possible to view the app in Expo Client on Android but doing/did a bunch of reading on how to create an iOS standalone version. Links to a lot of that reading below.

Other than the publishing thing, did lots of refactoring and renaming this morning.. feel pretty good about how all of that turned out. ‚û°Ô∏è [Merge branch 'feature/refactorStyles' ¬∑ arlenpeiffer/restock@4dc5829](https://github.com/arlenpeiffer/restock/commit/4dc5829e9127eba4cedd040118240441d3c6303d)

Also read some of *Clean Code* and looked into getting a laptop stand/external keyboard/mouse to help save my neck. Pretty alright day.

Also spent a little bit of time toying with adding a footer / 'Close' tab to the bottom of each Section component in Restock. Seems like a nice idea, probably finish that up tomorrow.

Ciao!


### Day 19
**Tuesday, November 5, 2019**

Spent most of the day today working on the Restock app and made quite a bit of progress. I feel like most of the styling is now pretty much done so unless anyone I show it to has suggestions for new features, I can start wrapping things up and maybe try to write some tests.

Here are a few things I learned about today:
- **SafeAreaView** ‚Äî renders nested content and automatically applies padding to reflect the portion of the view that is not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestor views. Moreover, and most importantly, Safe Area's paddings reflect the physical limitation of the screen, such as rounded corners or camera notches (i.e. the sensor housing area on iPhone X). Currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later.
- **marginHorizontal** ‚Äî¬†has the same effect as setting both marginLeft and marginRight.
- **marginVertical** ‚Äî¬†has the same effect as setting both marginTop and marginBottom.
- **Dimensions.get('window').height** and **Dimensions.get(‚Äòwindow‚Äô).width** ‚Äî¬†ways to access the device height and width (I think in pixels) using the React Native Dimensions class.
- [React Native Get Device Height Width on Button Click - DEV Community üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª](https://dev.to/skptricks/react-native-get-device-height-width-on-button-click-19ld)

- [react-native-normalize](https://github.com/NewBieBR/react-native-normalize)


### Day 18
**Monday, November 4, 2019**

Put in a copule hours after dinner on the Restock application. Got the navigation.navigate calls moved into the Header component and added some dynamic styles for indicating which nav item is currently selected. Did this by accessing the current index property on ``props.navigation.state`` and setting that equal to the respective index of each screen. The boolean from that then gets passed as prop isSelected to the styled NavigationItem component. Looks like this..

- ``isSelected={props.navigation.state.index === 0}  // Form``
- ``isSelected={props.navigation.state.index === 1}  // Checklist``

Took a bit of grappling with the React Navigation docs to realize that i didn't actually need to use their setParams and getParam functions in order to achieve the dynamic navigation styling I was aiming for (even though using those two functions seemed to be the most encouraged practice).

Anyways, that's about it for tonight. Ciao!

### Day 17
**Sunday, November 3, 2019**

Merged all of my commits from the last many days into the master branch! ü•≥

Felt good to wrap up all the changes and tidy things up a bit. Next step is gonna be adding a header to the application. Starting to look at the best ways to do this with React Navigaiton. Here are a few things I've learned so far and a few links to things to look into further:

- To remove the back button in the upper left corner when moving from one screen to another, we can set ``headerLeft: null`` on the ``navigationOptions`` object.
``` 
// inside of createStackNavigator RouteConfigs object..
Checklist: {
  screen: Checklist,
  navigationOptions: () => ({
    headerLeft: null
  })
}
```
- To add a specified component as the header we can again set a prop on the ``navigationOptions`` object, this time setting ``header: Header`` where Header is our specified component.
- Turns out I won't be needing this to access the navigation prop inside of Header (I guess it's considered part of our screen components?) but to gain access to props.navigation in any ol' component you can use the HOC withNavigation: [withNavigation ¬∑ React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/with-navigation.html#docsNav)

Alright, that's all for tonight. See ya tomorrow!


### Day 16
**Saturday, November 2, 2019**

Got to mess around with things for a couple hours before and after work today. Spent most of that time working on a function that searches the global state (order) for a given section + item combination, and if found returns either item.amount or item.isChecked and uses that value for the component initial state. Went through a few iterations (which I'll paste below) and in the end decided to try setting it up as a custom hook (useInitialState).

Outside of that (and also inside of that) spent a lot of time thinking about being precise with naming. Always a struggle but feel pretty good about where I ended up with everything.

Alright here are a few versions of the function I worked on today..

```
v1 (SectionItem version)
// not reusable at all, had to have different versions of the function for both components (SectionItem / ChecklistItem)

const setInitialValue = (order, section, item) => {
  let initialValue = 0;
  order.some(s => {
    if (s.name === section) {
      s.items.some(i => {
        if (i.name === item) {
          initialValue = i.amount;
        }
      });
    }
  });
  return initialValue;
};


v2
// more reusable but requires a long list of arguments and has no default value

const¬†findInitialValue¬†=¬†(order,¬†section,¬†item,¬†field)¬†=>¬†{
¬†¬†let¬†initialValue;
¬†¬†order.some(s¬†=>¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†if¬†(s.name¬†===¬†section)¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†s.items.some(i¬†=>¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†if¬†(i.name¬†===¬†item)¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†initialValue¬†=¬†i[field];
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†});
¬†¬†¬†¬†}
¬†¬†});
¬†¬†return¬†initialValue;
};


v3 (Custom hook version)
// still requires more arguments than I'd like but happier with the naming/clarity

const useInitialValue = (
  initialValueKey,
  defaultValue,
  sectionToMatch,
  itemToMatch
) => {
  const { order } = useContext(OrderContext);

  let initialValue = defaultValue;

  order.some(section => {
    if (section.name === sectionToMatch) {
      section.items.some(item => {
        if (item.name === itemToMatch) {
          initialValue = item[initialValueKey];
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return initialValue;
};
```

### Day 15
**Friday, November 1, 2019**

Oof. I feel so wiped from working on stuff all day. Seriously spent the whole day coding today. Made a lot of progress on the React Native project but also spent so many hours grappling with some silly things that hopefully will wind up sticking with me. Here's a little list of the day's accomplishments:

- Wrapped up/commited refactoring work from yesterday having to do with the object restructure/section key stuff
- Added ternary that swaps the section header icon when collapsed vs. expanded
- Refactors and styles the Checklist screen (spent a couple hours really digging into styled-components stuff this morning)
- And the big finale for the day was deciding to go in the other direction with the application global state (order) and change it from an object to an array, and to use useReducer/dispatch calls to manage changes instead of useState/setOrder. This was another good exercise but took me way too long. I wanna get better at figuring out how to break these things down faster and not feel like i'm stumbling through them for hours.

And some take aways:

- When using ``import * as types from './types'`` turns out you actually have to make sure to export the variables in types.js.. whoops!
- Can anyone write nice looking reducer files or do they all just look crazy?
- Don't forget, that property you're trying to access might be on the action object üôÉ
- It's seriously so rewarding figuring these problems out. Keep it up buddy.


### Day 14
**Thursday, October 31, 2019**

Got to work on things for a couple hours after work today. Felt lots better than yesterday thank goodness.

Made some structural changes to the order object in Restock. Ended up going with the idea of creating individual section keys that then contain an array of all of the items and amounts for that section/category. The function for updating the order object became much more complex when introducing the extra section key layer, but was a really good exercise for me. Here are the notes I took to help me visualize what I needed the function to do..

```
DOES SECTION KEY EXIST?
-- YES: IS AMOUNT > 0?
  -- YES: ADD ITEM KEY!
  -- NO: IS THIS THE LAST ITEM IN THE SECTION?
    -- YES: REMOVE SECTION KEY!
    -- NO: REMOVE ITEM KEY!
-- NO: ADD SECTION KEY!
```

A few other fun things I learned/solidified today:
- Object dot notation ( `object.property` ) requires that property is a valid JavaScript identifier
	- An **identifier** is a sequence of characters that identifies a variable, function, or property. In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, $, _, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit.
- Object bracket notation ( `object[property]` ) does not require property to be a valid identifier ‚Äî it can have any value, e.g. "1foo", "!bar!", or even " "
- To remove the last letter of a string you can use `str.slice(0, -1)`

### Day 13
**Wednesday, October 30, 2019**

Made a few commits today on Restock.. got the most basic version of the Checklist screen happening and rendering ChecklistItem components for each item in the order. After that explored some other options for data structure (seeing if might make more sense to store the order data as an array rather than an object, and also if it might be worth it to store items on a section object so that items can be organized by section/headers can be rendered on the Checklist screen for each group of items).

Don't know why but this second part of the day felt really tough. Was one of those days where I felt like I didn't know anything about JavaScript, or like I'd never seen or heard of any of the built-in Object or Array methods. Starting to feel kinda under the weather so maybe it has something to do with that. ü§í

Either way, better luck tomorrow

Ciao!


### Day 12
**Tuesday, October 29, 2019**

Made a bunch of commits for the project today! Merged all of my changes from the last few days ‚Äî completing my work on the section feature for now ‚Äî and improved the function managing the app's global order state. (It now removes a key from the order object if the amount for an item is 0).

Also merged a bunch of automated pull requests this morning for a handful of github repos with high severity security vulnerabilities. Was my first time merging pull requests that weren't just me merging a branch, so that felt cool.

My interview for 8th Light is tomorrow, so spent a little time getting ready for that as well!

**A useful link from the day:**
- [Color Name & Hue ‚Äì Colblindor](http://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/) ‚Äî¬†*great tool for looking up the specific name of colors*


### Day 11
**Monday, October 28, 2019**

Didn't have a ton of time to work on things today but did get to play around with styled-compnents for an hour or so. Got the counter component looking/feeling a little better and was able to get rid of some unnecessary css.

A few questions/thoughts from the day:
- Getting used to the the fact that the default value for ``flex-direction`` in React Native is ``column`` and not ``row`` like it is for web stuff..
- In React Native, do you have to set ``display: flex`` in order to use ``align-items``/``justify-content`` or can you just use them?

### Day 10
**Sunday, October 27, 2019**

Had the day off today and got to spend most of it coding. Feel like I covered a lot of ground.

This morning I worked on getting Context all set up for the Restock app. Renamed some things for clarity (AppContext becomes OrderContext, count gets swapped out for amount) and replaced instances of Consumer with useContext calls. I think the changes made things much cleaner and all seems to be working pretty well.

After that I got to learn about React Native's ScrollView, how styling a ScrollView with styled-components requires a slightly different syntax, and how flex in React Native differs from flex in the browser. Links below.

Lastly, spent a couple hours working on setting up and styling a Counter component that manages the current amount for each SectionItem. Was fun playing around with dynamic styling in styled-components üíÖ

Here are a few links from the day:
- [Taming React Native‚Äôs ScrollView with flex - Peter Piekarczyk - Medium](https://medium.com/@peterpme/taming-react-natives-scrollview-with-flex-144e6ff76c08)

- [wesbos/css-colours-sorted: CSS Colours Sorted By](https://github.com/wesbos/css-colours-sorted)


### Day 9
**Saturday, October 26, 2019**

Spent a few hours this morning playing around with Restock and trying to think through the best way to handle sharing state between the Form and Checklist screens. Looking into params in React Navigation and Context in React. Thinking it might be Context, but we'll see what tomorrow brings.

Also, realized today that I could for sure spend some more time committing to memory the built-in Array methods and how they work/what they return.

Links:
- [Passing parameters to routes ¬∑ React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/params.html)
- [Context ‚Äì React](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- [Array - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)


### Day 8
**Friday, October 25, 2019**

Spent today playing around with Restock some more, mostly just continuing from where I left off yesterday. Sorted out what actually needs to be included for the babel-plugin-module-resolver to work (seems like just an alias prop containing an object with the paths you'd like to create aliases for), so feeling pretty comfortable/confident with that now. Got to use ``Shift + R`` a fair amount while getting all my new paths set up üòâ

Also got my two views/screens set up (Form & Checklist) and basic navigation between the two is working. Currently that's being done by using the navigate function on the navigation prop in React Navigate. Lots of that word today. A note on the navigation prop..

- Each¬†``screen``¬†component in your app is provided with the¬†``navigation``¬†prop automatically. The prop contains various convenience functions that dispatch navigation actions on the route's router. https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigation-prop.html

Beyond that just started setting up a Section component to be used inside of Form. Each Section will manage it's own expanded/collapsed state, which in turn will decide whether any of the items belonging to that section are rendered. Got the basics working but excited to keep exploring.

Next steps (or maybe not next, but steps to take at some point soon):
- add tests to the project
- try adding animations for expanding/collapsing menus
- work on taking more breaks

Alright, see ya tomorrow!


### Day 7
**Thursday, October 24, 2019**

Started setting up the basic file structure and navigation for Restock app. Got a little sidetracked by wanting to use babel-plugin-module-resolver for absolute pathnames in my imports, so didn't end up getting as far as I wanted to with the set up process. Did eventually figure out the absolute pathname thing (turns out ``Shift + R`` clears the cache and forces a reload of the babel.config.js file in Expo) but was definitely a little fried by the time I got there.

Here are some notes I took on setting up an Expo project with React Navigation:

**Initializing an Expo project**
- From the directory where you‚Äôd like to create a project run
	``expo init project-name`` or simply ``expo init``
- Choose a template/workflow:
    * blank ‚Äî a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
    * blank (TypeScript) ‚Äî same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
    * tabs ‚Äî¬†several example screens and tabs using react-navigation
    * minimal ‚Äî bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started
    * minimal (TypeScript) ‚Äî same as minimal but with TypeScript configuration
- Enter a name (the name of your app visible on the home screen) and a slug (a url friendly name for your app¬†‚Äî¬†this will also be the name of the project folder if none was specified when running ``expo init``)
- Choose whether or not to use yarn to install dependencies

**Starting the project**
- From the project directory run either ``yarn start`` or ``expo start``

**Adding react-naviagation**
- From the project directory run ``expo install react-navigation react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens``

**Setting up react-navigation**

React Navigation's stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history. To use React Navigation‚Äôs stack navigator:
- ``yarn add react-navigation-stack``
- ``import { createStackNavigator } from ‚Äòreact-navigation-stack‚Äô``
- ``import { createAppContainer } from ‚Äòreact-navigation‚Äô``

**createStackNaviagtor** is a function that returns a React component. It takes¬†a route configuration object¬†and, optionally,¬†an options object.

**createAppContainer** is a function that returns a React component to take as a parameter the React component created by the¬†createStackNavigator, and can be directly exported from¬†App.js¬†to be used as our App's root component. *(???)*

And lasty...

A question from the day...

**Q:** Do components in React Native have to be class components?

### Day 6
**Wednesday, October 23, 2019**

Today was a really fun day of exploring. I got to spend pretty much the entire day working on coding, and I feel really proud of where I'm at today. There were some definite moments throughout the day that I noticed a new level of comfort ‚Äî an almost second nature kind of thing ‚Äî with certain tasks (using nvm, setting up new repos on github and sourcetree) and a collectedness that I don't always feel when running into issues or error messages. Definitely feeling back on track a little more after today.

Here are the day's takeaways..

- Started out the day by doing some reading/exploring about React Native (been thinking about building my next project with that) and through that exploration found Expo, which seems really cool. Spent a good part of the day playing around with the Expo CLI/DevTools and Expo Client for iOS. Ran into lots of new errors I've never seen before, but worked through all of them and everything seems to be up and running.
    - https://expo.io
    - https://github.com/expo/expo
    - https://github.com/expo/expo-cli
    - https://blog.expo.io/expo-cli-2-0-released-a7a9c250e99c
    
- Learned about using absolute paths as opposed to relative paths for imports (ex: ``import Header from 'components/Header'`` instead of ``import Header from '../../components/Header``) using babel-plugin-module-resolver.
    - https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver

- Brushed up on some terminal commands for nvm and learned how to set the default version of node by using ``nvm alias default 12.13.0``.

- Did a short React Native/Expo tutorial where we built a little Netflix clone. Apparently some breaking changes with react-navigation (a package used in the tutorial) have occurred since it was written, so got to do some doc reading/problem solving to get everything working as expected.
    - https://codeburst.io/getting-started-with-expo-react-native-and-styled-components-using-a-netflix-clone-example-652c7cb2a794
    
- Lastly, found out installing Xcode takes a really long time (but that the iOS simulator built into it is pretty fun) üì±

Oh, and one last thing.. found out I got a phone interview with 8th Light! üòÑ

Quite a day. Excited to keep at it. See ya tomorrow!


### Day 5
**Tuesday, October 22, 2019**

Ladies and gentlemen, he's finally done it.. he finally reached the end of The Complete React Developer Course üéâ

The last few lessons in the course focused on the useReducer Hook, Context and the useContext Hook, Fragments, and creating custom React Hooks. Here are a few take aways..

``useReducer``
- awfully similar to the idea of reducers in Redux ü§î
- takes (2) arguments ‚û°Ô∏è a reducer function and the initial state
- returns an array containing (2) things ‚û°Ô∏è state and a dispatch function
- ultimately allows us to remove complex state logic from our component and store it in a separate function, making our component easier to manage and making the reducer easier to reuse

``useContext``
- takes (1) argument ‚û°Ô∏è a context object
- returns ‚û°Ô∏è the value being shared via Context (ie. whatever was passed as the value prop to Provider)
- you can destructure just the things you need from the return value of useContext like so: ``const { notes } = useContext(NotesContext);``

Also, got a little refresher on event listeners during the lesson on creating custom hooks.. ``document.addEventListener()`` and ``document.removeEventListener()`` both take (2) arguments ‚û°Ô∏è the event to listen for and the function to run when the event occurs. I gotta go back and spend a little time playing with event listeners again, as well as explore what other fun things can be done with event targets like document and window.


### Day 4
**Monday, October 21, 2019**

Completed 3 lessons on useEffect. Turns out it's pretty üÜí. Here are some take aways..

- useEffect is kind of like a replacement for lifecycle methods in our class-based components
- useEffect takes a function as its first argument
- that function runs once right away (similar to ``componentDidMount``) and again any time component state or props change (similar to ``componentDidUpdate``) unless an optional second argument is provided
- the optional second argument is an array of values (called dependencies) that specify which prop or state changes useEffect should care about or respond to
- if an empty array is provided as the second argument, useEffect will run just once when the component mounts (useful for fetching or reading data)
- useEffect can also mimic ``componentDidUnmount`` by returning a function that will run if the component instance is removed from the DOM

Other take aways:
- TIL you can dynamically change the title of a page by setting ``document.title`` equal to a variable ü§Ø
- just a friendly reminder that you gotta use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse when working with localStorage..

Some more reading on useEffect:
- [A Complete Guide to useEffect ‚Äî Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)
- [Hooks API Reference ‚Äì React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)


### Day 3
**Sunday, October 20, 2019**

Completed Section 18 and started on Section 19 of the Complete React Developer Course. In Section 18 I got practice gutting a ‚Äòfinished‚Äô project to create a boilerplate repo, wiping the git history ( ``rm -rf .git`` ), initializing a new git repository ( ``git init`` ), and making an initial commit ( ``git add .`` followed by ``git commit`` ). Section 19 starts off by talking about create-react-app in depth and then moves into looking at hooks. Completed 3 lessons on the useState hook which served as a good review. Excited for tomorrow to start digging into some hooks I have a little less experience with (useEffect, useReducer, useContext). Ciao!


### Day 2
**Saturday, October 19, 2019**

Completed the rest of Section 17  of the Complete React Developer Course! Got some good practice working with media queries/breakpoints, creating & importing partial files/using selectors to target specific elements or decendants of specific elements, and setting up variables for reusing colors, font sizes/styles, and margin/padding amounts.

Also had a good refresher on the difference between inline and inline-block..

**display: inline**
- **cannot** set width and height of an element
- top & bottom margins are **not** respected

**display: inline-block**
- can set width and height of an element
- top & bottom margins are respected

Deployed version of the Expensify app with added styles is up at https://e-x-pensify.herokuapp.com/


### Day 1
**Friday, October 18, 2019**

Picked back up with Section 17 of Andrew Mead's Complete React Developer Course. Completed the first two videos of the section which detailed the process of refactoring and adding styles to LoginPage and Header. It was fun seeing Sass again (maybe it's been close to a year?) and trying to remember some of the concepts (partials, nested selectors, variables, BEM).

Also had to solve an error being thrown by Firebase due to missing .env files (sadly lost in the Great Hard Drive Crash of September 2019 üò™). Had everything back up and running in just a handful of minutes, which I was really proud of.
